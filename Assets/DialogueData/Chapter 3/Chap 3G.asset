  - That was awesome!
  - See? I told you. This place is indeed really fun but there will be more places
    that are so much fun than this one
  - "But I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do with this bottle that I found
    earlier"
  - Hmmm OH I KNOW!
  - "There\u2019s someone that I know who owns a shop where you can donate your goods.
    I think you can take the bottle to the shop so it won\u2019t go in vain."
  - "Oooh, sounds good. Let\u2019s go there"
  - Hello Mr. Jenkins!
  - Oh, Hi Maggie, welcome! It seems you bring your friend over here, yes?
  - Yes sir, my friend happens to want to donate thisold bottle to you. He found
    it in the lake while he was fishing.
  - Oh is that so? Wait a second, let me get my glasses first
  - "Wow, you\u2019re very lucky today, kid"
  - Huh? What kind of bottle is it, sir?
  - This is a leftover bottle from a World War, dating back decades. The engravings
    are still visible even though it's covered in rust. It's very rare.
  - So, are you sure you want to donate this bottle?
  - Yes, sir, because I don't know where else to take it. It would be such a waste
    to throw it away, so I thought I'd donate it to you instead.
  - "Oooh alright, if you say so, kid. I\u2019ll take it."
  - Oh by the way, I got something for you
  - Earlier, some man left a torn photo with me and said it was for a boy wearing
    a bucket hat. I think you are the boy.
  - A photo?
  - '*"Hey kiddo, it''s been a while since we last met. If you''re reading this,
    I want you to know that you''re a smart, strong, and amazing kid.*'
  - "*I'm proud of you, buddy. Can't believe it's been three years already. You've
    gro-\u201D*"
  - If I may ask, do you know where this man is going to after he stopped by here?
  - As far as I know, this man went to the north side of Kalimakan forest.. It just
    happened in the blink of an eye when I was about to ask him.
  - "Very interesting, I feel like there\u2019s something deeper than that, isn\u2019t
    it?"
  - "I think so, I want to get to know more about this torn photo. There\u2019s something
    fishy from this photo and I will find out."
  - Ooooooh I sense an adventure right here :3
  - Okay then, thank you for the heads up, Mr. Jenkins. Maggie and I will head out
    soon. See you!
  - Goodbye Mr. Jenkins!
  - See you later kids, I hope everything goes well on your journey, kid
  - Mhm!
