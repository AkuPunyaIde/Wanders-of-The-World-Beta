  dialogue:
  - This photo was taken when my mom and I went to visit Dad at the hospital. Dad
    said he had to learn how to walk again on the Earth's surface
  - after having too much fun moonwalking in space. By the time Dad got to meet my
    mom and me, he was walking quite jumpily like a rabbit.
