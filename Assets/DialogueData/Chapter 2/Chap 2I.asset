  dialogue:
  - "Alright then, If you\u2019re still here being silent, I don\u2019t have problem
    with that. Let me know if you want to talk. I\u2019ll be here."
  - "Umm how\u2019s your day going, dad?"
  - "I\u2019m fine. How about you, Kyle?"
  - "I\u2019m fine too, dad"
  - Oh how was your school today?
  - It was good. Plus some assignments as usual
  - What kind of assignments?
  - They are Indonesian language study and mathematics
  - Can you do the assignments?
  - Yes, I can.
  - "oh, that\u2019s good to know. Great!"
  - Umm, dad, can I ask you something?
  - Oh? What is it, Kyle?
  - "Ummm if you don\u2019t mind me asking, why did you want to marry with mom?"
  - The reason I married your mom is because I want to ease her burden.
  - "I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re aware that your mom\u2019s field of job is
    not a piece of cake. "
  - "She\u2019s the backbone who\u2019s working tirelessly to support this family,
    especially you."
  - "I was planning to replace your mom\u2019s role so that she could have a better
    life and not be sad about someone she cares about."
  - "However, your mom still insist to continue on working because she\u2019s already
    in that position. So, what else can I do"
  - "Oh, it\u2019s already 8 PM. Go back inside the house, Kyle. It\u2019s getting
    late."
  - Yes, dad.
  - Kyle
  - "I\u2019m sorry for what happened earlier in the dining room. I didn\u2019t mean
    to scare you. I just got carried away by my emotions of what your mom said."
